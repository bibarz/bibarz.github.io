To play Time's up:

One person connects as chief: bibarz.github.io/timesup/index.html?chief=true

The rest connect non-chief: bibarz.github.io/timesup/index.html

Anyone can send cards, only the chief can decide when to start the game. The chief is collecting the cards and does not store them until the game begins, so if the chief reloads the page during the card-collection phase the cards sent so far will be lost.

Only the chief can terminate a game.
